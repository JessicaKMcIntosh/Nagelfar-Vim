Vim integration of Nagelfar for checking .tcl files.
This is done using the compiler/quickfix features of Vim.

Nagelfar can be downloaded from <http://nagelfar.berlios.de/>
This script is intended to be used with the latest version.

To install copy the files to ~/.vim or ~/vimfiles.
If using a package manager like pathgen place the whole directory in the bundle
directory.

At some point ':compiler nagelfar' needs to be called to use this plugin.
I recommend putting ':autocmd FileType tcl compiler nagelfar' in your ~/.vimrc
or ~/_vimrc file.
