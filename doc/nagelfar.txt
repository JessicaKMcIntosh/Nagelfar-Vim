==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION					*nagelfar-description*

Integrates Nagelfar with Vim using the |quickfix|/|compiler| features for
syntax checking of .tcl files. Settings are provided to control how Nagelfar
is called and behaves.

Nagelfar can be downloaded from <http://nagelfar.berlios.de/>
This script is intended to be used with the latest version.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*nagelfar-installation*

Copy the files to your ~/.vim or ~/vimfiles dorectory.
If using a package manager like pathgen place the whole directory in the
bundle directory.

At some point ':compiler nagelfar' needs to be called to use this plugin.
I recommend putting ':autocmd FileType tcl compiler nagelfar' in your ~/.vimrc
or ~/_vimrc file.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*nagelfar-commands*

Commands created for user use.

:NagelfarClear                                  *:NagelfarClear*
	Clear the signs created after running |:make|.

:NagelfarSigns                                  *:NagelfarSigns*
	Display the signs for the current buffer.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS					*nagelfar-mappings*

Convenience key mappings for working with Nagelfar and errors.
See |nagelfar-settings| for changing the prefix.

Note: These mappings are only created in buffers that have the Nagelfar
      compiler loaded. No other buffers, even the error window, have these
      mappings. The mappings are also only for normal mode.

<Leader>n[      |:cprevious|
	Move to the previous error.

<Leader>n]      |:cnext|
	Move to the next error.

<Leader>nc      |:NagelfarClear|
	Clears the signs created after a make.

<Leader>nC      |:cclose|
	Closes the error window.

<Leader>nM      |:make|!
	Checks the syntax but does not jump to the first error.

<Leader>nm      |:make|
	Checks the syntax then jumps to the first error.

<Leader>ns      |:NagelfarSigns|
	Displays the sign markers for the current buffer.
	This works regardless of the g:nagelfar_signs setting.

<Leader>nw      |:copen|
	Displays and/or switches to the error window.

Note: The |Leader| key is normally set to "\".
