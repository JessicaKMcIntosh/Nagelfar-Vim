==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION					*nagelfar-description*

Integrates Nagelfar with Vim using the |quickfix|/|compiler| features for
syntax checking of .tcl files. Settings are provided to control how Nagelfar
is called and behaves.

Nagelfar can be downloaded from <http://nagelfar.berlios.de/>
This script is intended to be used with the latest version.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*nagelfar-installation*

Copy the files to your ~/.vim or ~/vimfiles dorectory.
If using a package manager like pathgen place the whole directory in the
bundle directory.

At some point ':compiler nagelfar' needs to be called to use this plugin.
I recommend putting ':autocmd FileType tcl compiler nagelfar' in your ~/.vimrc
or ~/_vimrc file.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*nagelfar-commands*

Commands created for user use.

:NagelfarClear                                  *:NagelfarClear*
	Clear the signs created after running |:make|.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS					*nagelfar-mappings*

Convenience key mappings for working with Nagelfar and errors.
See |nagelfar-settings| for changing the prefix.
These mappings are only created in buffers that have the Nagelfar compiler
loaded. No other buffers, even the error window, have these mappings.

<Leader>n[      |:cprevious|
	Move to the precvious error.

<Leader>n]      |:cnext|
	Move to the next error.

<Leader>nc      |:NagelfarClear|
	Clears the signs created after a make.

<Leader>nM      |:make|!
	Checks the syntax but does not jump to the first error.

<Leader>nm      |:make|
	Checks the syntax then jumps to the first error.

<Leader>nw      |:cwindow|
	Displays the error window, if there are errors.
